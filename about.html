            <h3 class="content-heading">Our Story</h3>
            <p>
                The MACE Evangelical Union (EU) is a Christ-centered student fellowship dedicated to nurturing college students in their faith journey while enriching their campus experience. Born from a vision to see students transformed by Christ, we have been a vibrant spiritual home on campus for many years. We are a community where students can connect, grow, and serve, building a foundation of faith that lasts a lifetime.
            </p>
            <p>
                From humble beginnings, MACE EU has grown through dedicated prayer, faithful Bible study, and genuine fellowship. We believe in creating a welcoming environment where every student feels valued and can explore their faith freely. Our journey is one of continuous growth, guided by God's Word and the Holy Spirit.

            <h3 class="content-heading">What We Believe</h3>
            <p>
                At the core of MACE EU is a commitment to the foundational truths of Christianity. We believe in the authority of the Holy Bible as the inspired Word of God, the deity of Jesus Christ, His atoning death and resurrection, and salvation by grace through faith. We aim to equip students to understand, articulate, and live out these truths in their daily lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our fellowship emphasizes personal discipleship, evangelism, and a life of worship. We encourage students to develop a deep personal relationship with Jesus, to share their faith with others on campus, and to live in a way that honors God in all their endeavors.
