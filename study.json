        "summary": "1. False Zeal vs. True Purpose\n\n**The Agitators (\u201cThey\u201d):** The false teachers (connected to Gal. 3:1) are trying to pull you away from Paul so you become dependent on them. Their motives are self-centered, not godly.\n\n**Proper Zeal:** Zeal is good\u2014but only when the purpose is good. True spiritual passion should be consistent, not something that only appears when spiritual leaders like Paul are present.\n\n\n2. The Goal: Christ Formed in Us\n\n**Sanctification:** Receiving Jesus is just the beginning. The lifelong journey is Sanctification\u2014the process of becoming more like Jesus until \u201cChrist is fully formed in you.\u201d\n\n**The Blueprint (Romans 8:28\u201329):** God\u2019s ultimate purpose is that we be conformed to the image of His Son. This shaping continues throughout our entire life.\n\n\n3. How We Grow (The Process)\n\n**Personal Relationship:** True growth requires more than reading Scripture. We must meditate on it (Psalm 1) and let the Holy Spirit apply the Word to our hearts.\n\n**Self-Reflection:** Growth requires honest questions: Is my growth stunted? Am I still maturing spiritually?\n\n\n4. Concern for Others\n\nJust as Paul labored and felt deep concern for the Galatians, we should also desire that Christ is formed in others. Spiritual maturity means moving beyond self-focus toward encouraging, strengthening, and caring for the growth of those around us."
