    "content": "It’s easy to get lost in the \"Season\" on the left, but the \"Reason\" on the right changes everything. God showed His love not just by sending a baby, but by sending a Substitute. The thorns remind us that He loved us enough to suffer for us. This Christmas, the invitation isn't just to celebrate a holiday, but to know the Savior who gave everything for you. Merry Christmas—may you know the peace that comes from His sacrifice!",
